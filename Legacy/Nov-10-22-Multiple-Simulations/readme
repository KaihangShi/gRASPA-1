Code for performing multiple simulations in one setup on the GPU (also allows for parallelization of pairwise energies).

Currently working on translation/rotation moves. 

It has issues with internal compiler errors (see the email).

to compile, change the location of the cuda library in file "NVC_COMPILE", then execute that bash script. 

To change settings, take a look at the simulation.input file. You can change the number of moves to perform, what moves to perform, and adsorbate molecules (currently support methane/propane/CO2).
