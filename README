**Source**  folder contains all the LATEST source code file
**Input**   folder contains all the input files 
**Doc**     folder contains the documents related to the code (A github.io page will be available soon). 
**Legacy**  folder contains all the previous versions of the code, labeled with the month-date-year of the code.

**NOTE**
1. When the source code is updated, the current files in **Source** and **Input** will be moved to **Legacy**, with month-date-year labeled.
2. github.io page will be available soon. For now, just look at the Sphinx-generated webpages in the **Doc** folder.

1. Tail Correction (completed, will update next week)
2. Optimize Random Number on GPU (try cuRand)
3. Reformulate calculation of VDW+Real for Translation/Rotation, then CBMC
4. More Generalized function for easier use
5. Multiple Instance GPU?
6. Documentation with reference/comparison to RASPA-2 and RASPA-3
