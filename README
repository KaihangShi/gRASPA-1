Deep Potential Implementation of the CUDA-MC code. 
Code will be updated here, so that it does not interfere with the main repo.
Need Tensorflow-c++ api, cppflow package.

04/21/23 Update:
1. Detailed Comments about the initialization of the program
2. Flag for turning off the DNN potential

05/12/23 Update:
New Features:
1. mixture simulations
2. Separated VDW, Separated Real part Coulomb, and Separated Ewald Summation, and Separated host-guest/guest-guest for different types of energies.
3. Rewrote the code:
    1. using built-in vector types for positions and overloaded math operators
    2. Renamed functions to use meaningful names
    3. merged, deleted un-used functions and files. Simplified compilation.
    4. Simplified/merged MC moves functions, merged translation/rotation/(non-CBMC) swap moves, make cbmc moves more readable. 
Future:
1. make framework modular (separate into node/linker/cation/...)
2. Linker rotation, cation moves
3. turning on/off linker moves
4. Better speed for using deep-learning potentials in the code. 
5. (Maybe) Pressure/virial calculation
6. (Maybe) Molecular Dynamics

05/23/23 Update:
1. tensorflow model prediction on the CPU
2. user defined pseudo atom types for the model
3. openmp parallel for loops for preparing the features (sorting)
