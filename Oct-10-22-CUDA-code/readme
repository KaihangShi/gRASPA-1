to run, do "./nvc_main.x"

Need files: 
1. Restart file, in the Restart folder (will remove it later).
2. simulation.input file, contains all the instructions for the code (what adsorbate molecule to simulate, what MOF/zeolite, etc.)
3. poscar file for the structure (MOF/zeolite)
4. def files: force_field_mixing_rules.def (LJ parameters); pseudo_atoms.def (charges for pseudo-atoms); <molecule_name>.def (methane, CO2, ...)

When the simulation finishes, a lammps data file will be written in the Movies folder. the lammps data file can be visualized using OVITO. 

Zhao's note: this code cannot do ewald for now, but short-range coulombic interactions (q_i*q_j/r) is included. 

Search for "Zhao's note" in the code for caveats, unaddressed issues and potential future changes in the code.
