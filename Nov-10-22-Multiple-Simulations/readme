Code for performing multiple simulations in one setup on the GPU (also allowes for parallelization of pairwise energies).

Currently working on translation/rotation moves. 

It has issues with internal compiler errors (see the email).

to compile, change the location of the cuda library in file "NVC_COMPILE", then execute that bash script.
